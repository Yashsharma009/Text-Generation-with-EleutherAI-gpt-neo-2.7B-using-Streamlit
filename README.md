# Text Generation with EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B using Streamlit

This Streamlit app demonstrates text generation using the EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B model. Users can input a prompt, set the desired output length, and generate creative text based on their input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers
```

### Running the App

Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_name.py
```

Replace `your_app_name.py` with the name of your Python script.

## Usage

1. Enter a prompt in the text input field.
2. Adjust the output length using the slider.
3. Click the "Generate" button to generate text based on the input prompt.
